In order to get full usage of this project, an ArcGis database should be prepared with the following 3 items:
P  - Shapefile of polygons 
P* - A column in P containing names for each polygon
F  - Empty feature class of lines
D  - Table for data collection
     Columns should be as follows: [OBJECTID*, ReferenceObj, TargetObj, Dir, MidAngle]

All manipulations of these files can be done through the following 4 function executions:
collectIntersections(P,F)
collectSectors(P,P*,F,D)
simplifySectors(D)
boundingBoxes(P)

TexTableGenerator requires as input the output of both simplifySectors and boundingBoxes
Including a filename as an argument for either of those functions will make them write their output to that file

AxiomGenerator has no file dependencies
